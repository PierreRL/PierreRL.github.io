            <h1>Ultimate Frisbee</h1>
            <p>I was looking for some new sport with some new people that I could enjoy each week at university, so
                after enjoying some taster sessions and a beginners tournament, I started in year 2 semester 1.
            </p>
            <p>A lesser known sport in the UK, ultimate frisbee is unfortunately an American import but is now evolving
                into its own discipline which need not be tied down to its gun-infused roots. It is often described as a
                mix of netball and American football with a frisbee - which is more or less accurate. In a game, there
                are 2 teams, each with 5 or 7 playeres for indoors or outdoors respectively, who each line up at an
                endzone at each side of the pitch. The defenders then launch the game disc (a 'pull') to the offensive
                side, who then try to advance up the pitch. A point is scored when a player catches the disc in the
                opposing endzone. It is a non-contact sport, so no direct tackling. You cannot run with the disc, only
                pivot on one foot, and you have 8-10
                seconds to pass the disc. If the disc is dropped or goes out of play, it is a turnover and the defense
                and offense switch. Notably, it is also a self-refereed sport, where disagreements about rules are
                talked about and resolved in a civilised manner (usually).</p>
            <p>There are generally 2 kinds of players - cutters and handlers. Handlers are normally throwing while
                cutters are found running around like headless chickens trying to make space to catch the disc. I like
                to run so normally I'm cutting, but as my throwing improves I'm enjoy trying to handle sometimes too.
            </p>
            <p>The sport is just a lot of fun, and throwing a frisbee is fun regardless. What's more is the club at the
                University of Edinburgh (Ro Sham Bo - don't ask me about the name) is very nice and was
                very welcoming to me as a beginner in second year.</p>
