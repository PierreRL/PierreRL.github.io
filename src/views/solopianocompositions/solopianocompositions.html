            <h1>Solo piano compositions</h1>
            <p>While I have since come up with many more little tunes, melodies, production ideas, chord sequences and
                motifs, my first 3 compositions were all for solo piano, and are all in a <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I722pOokTx4&list=PL0pDn6c2V-mVW8x3wP37Gqn21ETP6cwTE">playlist</a>
                on youtube.</p>
            <h2>Vexed in Eb Major</h2>
            <p>Beyond very simiple melodies I'd played around with, this was my very first finished piece of music. It
                was created partly for Higher music, but it ended up not being used for examination, and so in the end
                it was just for fun - the best reason.</p>
            <p>The piece starts with a melody heavily inspired by the chorus of REM's Everybody Hurts before
                transitioning into an erratic and surprising quasi-chorus. Progression continues by settling into a C
                section which functions sort of like a bridge in the middle of the piece, with some left hand movement
                I'm still quite pleased with to this day. The piece then reruns the verse-chorus from the beginning with
                some varirations, the most notable of which being the Everybody hurts chords being outline by both hands
                with the melody being played alternately by each swapping hand, inspired by the main theme of Franz
                Lizst's Un Sospiro.</p>
            <h2>Sad in E Minor</h2>
            <p>Created during a lockdown-infused period of piano obsession, and as a kind of rebuttal to my sister's
                appreciation of Einaudi's works, I thought I'd create my own minimalist piece. All this means that it's
                very repetitive, there's a strong verse-chorus structure, and there is constant build up and release. I
                am a particular fan of the main theme, directly inspried by the main theme from Einaudi's Divenere. The
                rest is a nice-ish piece but nothing spectacular.</p>
            <h2>Hope in E Major</h2>
            <p>After I spent a rather intense week nearer the end of lockdown learning Debussy's Arabesque No. 1, I was
                struck with inspiration for my Advanced Higher Music composition to create a piece based on it. Once
                again, the composition for the exam was cancelled but the piece remained and this is the one I am
                proudest of. Like Arabesque No. 1, it is in E major, the main melody makes heavy use of 3:2 polyrhythms
                and there is a clear ABACA structure. </p>
            <p>I am particularly happy with my application of my understanding of harmony. While the melodies are nice
                too, it is the chordal structures and progressions I really like. I think I did a good job of creating
                new, but similar-feeling sounds to the original piece. Hope you enjoy listening! </p>
