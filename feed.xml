It is often described as a mix of netball and American football with a frisbee - which is more or less accurate. In a game, there are 2 teams, each with 5 or 7 players for indoors or outdoors respectively, who each line up at an endzone at each side of the pitch. The defenders then launch the game disc (a ‚Äòpull‚Äô) to the offensive side, who then try to advance up the pitch. A point is scored when a player catches the disc in the opposing endzone. It is a non-contact sport, so no direct tackling. You cannot run with the disc, only pivot on one foot, and you have 10 seconds to pass the disc. If the disc is dropped or goes out of play, it is a turnover and the defense and offense switch. Notably, it is also a self-refereed sport, where disagreements about rules are talked about and resolved in a (usually) civilised manner.</p> <p>There are generally 2 kinds of players - cutters and handlers. Handlers are normally throwing while cutters are found running around like headless chickens trying to make space to catch the disc. I like to run so normally I‚Äôm cutting, but as my throwing improves I‚Äôm enjoy trying to handle sometimes too.</p> <div class="row mt-4 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-auto mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex align-items-center"> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/frisbee/muddy-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/frisbee/muddy-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/frisbee/muddy-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/frisbee/muddy.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 60%; " data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Muddy lay-out training</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The sport is just a lot of fun, and throwing a frisbee is fun regardless.

The majority of the research was conducted here, which involved some blood tests, oxygen saturations, reaction tests, eye tests and lots of questionnaires. And of course, some walking and climbing of the surrounding Andes was compulsory for those of us with any measure of sanity.</p> <p>Those 2 weeks concluded the research, and we were let loose into the wilds of South America to do as we please. About half of our troupe (18 or so) decided we hadn‚Äôt gone high enough and we ascended Huyana Potosi once more, but this time reached the summit at a breezy 6,080m altitude. This only took 2 days of climbing, but the final day involved a 1am start with 11 hours of walking with crampons and ice axes, and if you tried to eat or drink your fingers would freeze.</p> <div class="row mt-4 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex align-items-center"> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/south_america/huyana-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/south_america/huyana-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/south_america/huyana-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/south_america/huyana.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">The sunrise from 6,000m</figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex align-items-center"> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/south_america/huyana2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/south_america/huyana2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/south_america/huyana2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/south_america/huyana2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Summit of Huyana Potosi (6,088m)</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The remainder of the travel was done in smaller groups.
