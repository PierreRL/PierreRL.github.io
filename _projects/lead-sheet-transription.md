My dissertation is on lead sheet transcription with deep learning. I wanted to bring some music into my big solo project for the year. I have a specific focus on automatic chord recognition. You can find the [Github here](https://github.com/PierreRL/LeadSheetTranscription). More details will come after the dissertation is finished after this semester.
